# openSAFT
An open implementation of the Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT). 
This code was created initially for ultrasonic concrete inspection. The purpose
behind releasing the code is to promote discussion and open exploration of the 
SAFT method for concrete non-destructive inspection. 


# Submissions
-This is an open project, the authors welcome suggestions, new code, and posting of problem datasets. 
-Q.C. is missing from this processing method completely. Please feel free to suggest Q.C. Algorithms. 


# Disclaimer 
This code was written based upon existing literature, and some creative problem solving to speed up the process. 
The enclosed code is for research purposes and education purposes. The author makes not claim to accuracy 
of the methods used. If you find an error, or poor assumption please fix it and send in your code.
